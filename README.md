# Satellite Decoders

A few small projects aimed at decoding various satellites that are more of an experiment here (may be redundant with other projects sharing the same code).
Mostly WIP stuff, or small programs here and there.

## FengYun Decoder

A small standalone program that makes frames from synced FY-3 symbols. Basically a FengYun decoder!
